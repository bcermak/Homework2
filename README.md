## Personal Portfolio ##

This week was quite the challenge. Intially, I created all three webpages without the proper grid format - I had created columns where I intended to create rows. I then began writing my code again from scratch. 

## About Me ##

The "About Me" section includes a photo pulled from my LinkedIn account and a brief description of what lead me to this program. 

There is a navbar, a row with "about me", a row with my image & text paragraph, and finally, a row with the footer I created. 

## Contact ##

I used code from Bootstrap to create a contact form. From there, I styled the buttons, text, and size of the comment box to better match the theme of the webpages. The navbar, form, and footer are all in their own rows.

## Portfolio ##

The navbar is in it's own row, followed by the heading Portfolio in a row, the content of the portfolio in a row, and finally, a row containing the created footer

I found temporary images online that are acting as placeholders in my portfolio for the future content that will come. 

## In Conclusion ##

All 3 web pages contain links to each other's address, are responsive to different device sizes, and share a consistent theme across all pages.
